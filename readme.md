# Introduction
Dijkstra Algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

# Instructions to Run the Code
Download the source code named **dijkstra.py** from the code folder inside the repository. If Python IDE is used, please click on the run button
Note : Before running please make sure whether these libraries are installed in the system : numpy,cv2,matplotlib,time,pygame.
Any Library not present can be by typing below command in terminal window using pip:

       pip install pygame
       

### Test Case 1 : 
	# Please enter the following for each prompt once the code is executed. Press enter after each value entered
	Enter the x-coordinate of start node
	 6
	Enter the y-coordinate of start node
	 6
	Enter the x-coordinate of goal node
	 110
	Enter the y-coordinate of goal node
	 100
### Test Case 2 : 
	Enter the x-coordinate of start node
	 6
	Enter the y-coordinate of start node
	 6
	Enter the x-coordinate of goal node
	 200
	Enter the y-coordinate of goal node
	 200




1. Once the code is run, a few information about the code is printed on the console and the Pygame visualisation video is displayed onto the screen
Note : Since PyGame Window has origin of Y on left upper corner. The Node starts from there
2. Close the Pygame Window once the point robot reaches goal node
3. If Using, VSCode or Spyder you will also see a final plot of the map using Opencv and Matplotlib

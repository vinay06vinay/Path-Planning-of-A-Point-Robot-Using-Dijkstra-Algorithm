# Instructions to Run the Code : 

1. From the extracted zip file, take out the "vinay06_Project2.py" file and open any Python IDE
3. If Python IDE is used, please click on the run button
Note : Before running please make sure whether these libraries are installed in the system : numpy,cv2,matplotlib,time,pygame.
Any Library not present can be by typing below command in terminal window using pip:
       pip install pygame
       
## Input Format for Two Test Cases : Click on enter after entering a value at each prompt

### Test Case 1 : 
	Enter the x-coordinate of start node
	 6
	Enter the y-coordinate of start node
	 6
	Enter the x-coordinate of goal node
	 110
	Enter the y-coordinate of goal node
	 100
### Test Case 2 : 
	Enter the x-coordinate of start node
	 6
	Enter the y-coordinate of start node
	 6
	Enter the x-coordinate of goal node
	 200
	Enter the y-coordinate of goal node
	 200




4. Once the code is run, a few information about the code is printed on the console and the Pygame visualisation video is displayed onto the screen
Note : Since PyGame Window has origin of Y on left upper corner. The Node starts from there
5. Close the Pygame Window once the point robot reaches goal node
6. If Using, VSCode or Spyder you will also see a final plot of the map using Opencv and Matplotlib
